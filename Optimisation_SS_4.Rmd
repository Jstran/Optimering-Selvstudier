# Exercise 1: OLS

Explain and show different ways to solve an OLS problem (e.g. `cars` dataset) using matrix factorisations.

# Exercise 2: NLS

In this exercise the `USPop` data from the `car` package is used (`data(USPop, package = "car")`).

Analyse this data as an NLS problem. Include discussion of starting values (see "Nonlinear Regression and Nonlinear Least Squares in R" by John Fox & Sanford Weisberg, available at Moodle).

Discuss which of Gauss-Newton (`nls()`) and Levenberg-Marquardt (`minpack.lm` library) that are more fragile to starting values.

Can you solve this optimisation problem in other ways than by Gauss-Newton/Levenberg-Marquardt?

# Exercise 3: Be creative!

If you have anything, put it here.
