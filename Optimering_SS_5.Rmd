# Exercise 1: Conjugate gradient

Implement the linear conjugate gradient algorithm and compare it with one or more general optimisation methods (e.g. steepest descent, BFGS, ...). For example by plotting the gradient norm and/or error norm at each iteration.

The comparison could for example be done by considering a linear regression problem (e.g. `cars`) and/or a quadratic form and its corresponding formulation of solving a linear system of equations.

# Exercise 2: Non-linear conjugate gradient

What are the differences between non-linear and linear conjugate gradient methods? 

Experiment with `R`'s implementation of conjugate gradient: `optim(par, fn, gr, method = "CG")` (see `?optim`). Use it to solve an optimisation problem.

# Exercise 3: Conjugate gradient

When are conjugate gradient methods useful? How is the linear conjugate gradient different from for example solving the corresponding normal equations directly?

# Exercise 4: Be creative!

If you have anything, put it here.
